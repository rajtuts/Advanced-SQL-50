Write a solution to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+-------+
| customer_id | name  |
+-------------+-------+
| 1           | Alice |

| 3           | Tom   |
| 4           | Jerry |
| 5           | John  |
+-------------+-------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |

| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 3          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 3          | screen       |
| 3           | 3          | screen       |
| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.

-- Solution
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Oracle & MySQL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
-- first create cte1 with count
-- then cte2 with rank using that count
-- then fetch rows with rnk = 1, join for product name

with cte1 as
    (select customer_id, product_id, count(product_id) as count_product
    from Orders
    group by customer_id, product_id),
    cte2 as
    (select customer_id, product_id, 
        dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id  order by count_product desc) as rnk
    from cte1)

select c.customer_id, c.product_id, p.product_name
from cte2 c
join Products p
on p.product_id = c.product_id
where rnk = 1 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
-- same as above, but combined cte1 and cte2 into 1 table- used count() directly inside rank()
  
with cte2 as
    (select customer_id, product_id, 
        dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id  order by count(product_id)  desc) as rnk
    from Orders
    group by 1, 2)

select c.customer_id, c.product_id, p.product_name
from cte2 c
join Products p
on p.product_id = c.product_id
where rnk = 1
